<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Your program has successfully hacked the new system! However, you've been spotted: the admin noticed your first failed attempts, found the vulnerability and made a patch. You should overcome this patch and hack the system again. It’s not easy being a hacker!</p>

<p>The admin has improved the server: the program now catches the exception and sends a simple ‘wrong password’ message to the client even when the real password starts with current symbols.</p>

<p>But here's the thing: the admin probably just caught this exception. We know that catching an exception takes the computer a long time, so there should be a delay in the server response when this exception takes place. You can use it to hack the system: count the time period in which the response comes and find out which starting symbols work out for the password.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, you should write a program that uses the time vulnerability to find the password.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use the list of logins from the previous stage.</li>
	<li>Output the result as you did this in the previous stage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="language-python">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; python hack.py localhost 9090
{
    "login" : "su",
    "password" : "fTUe3O99Rre"
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; python hack.py localhost 9090
{"login": "admin3", "password": "mlqDz33x"}</code></pre>

<h2><strong>Hint</strong></h2>

<p>To get the time difference between two execution points, you actually can subtract one <code class="language-python">datetime</code> object from another like in the following example: </p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from datetime import datetime

start = datetime.now()
...
finish = datetime.now()
difference = finish - start</code></pre>
