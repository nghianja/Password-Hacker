# Project: Password Hacker
### About
All sorts of creatures lurk around the Internet, including trolls, pirates, miners – and hackers. In this project you’ll wear the hat of a real hacker. You must connect to a secret server without knowing the password. Your task is to write a Python program that can hack this password, and do so in the quickest way possible.
### Learning outcomes
You will learn how hacking works. You will work with iterators and generators, and you’ll learn a little something about the itertools module – one of the most powerful features of Python. You will practice developing a client app and connecting to a server using the socket module. The project will also get you acquainted with JSON and the time module.
### This project is a part of the following track
Python Developer
## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
### Stage 1/5: Server connection
For starters, let’s pretend the admin's website isn't protected at all. Learn how to connect to the server and receive data from it to access private information.
### Stage 2/5: Simple brute force
OK, the admin has pumped up the server and it is now password-protected. But the password is probably short. Let's hack it by applying brute force (and no, that does not mean taking a jackhammer to the physical server!).
### Stage 3/5: Dictionary brute force
The admin has picked up on our attempts to access the server, so now it is protected with a more complex password. Maybe the password is long but not unique? Let's hack it using a dictionary of the most common passwords!
### Stage 4/5: Catching exception
The admin is really taking the case seriously. Now it is necessary to specify a valid login and password, and the password cannot be cracked by brute force. And yet, there is a vulnerability in the system that you can exploit to identify the admin's login and password.
### Stage 5/5: Time vulnerability
The admin has reacted quickly and made a patch that removes the vulnerability. It's time to look for another one. Poor admin…
